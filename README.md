## Overview

## ðŸ§  Abstract

Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates **Grounding DINO** with **SAM2** to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs.

A total of 18 public ultrasound datasetsâ€”covering breast, thyroid, liver, prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscleâ€”were utilized. These datasets were split into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using **Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, and 3 were held out entirely for testing to evaluate generalization to unseen distributions.

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method **outperforms** state-of-the-art segmentation baselines, including **UniverSeg**, **MedSAM**, **MedCLIP-SAM**, **BiomedParse**, and **SAMUS** on most seen datasets, while also maintaining strong performance on **unseen** datasets without further fine-tuning.

These findings highlight the potential of VLMs in **scalable**, **robust**, and **automated** ultrasound image analysis, reducing reliance on large, organ-specific annotated datasets.

## ðŸ—‚ Datasets

This study utilized **18 public ultrasound datasets** spanning a wide range of anatomical targets: **breast, thyroid, liver, prostate, kidney**, and **paraspinal muscle**. These were divided into:

- **15 datasets** for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO
- **3 held-out datasets** (highlighted below) for **testing on unseen domains** (no exposure during training or validation)

While most baselines used the same training and test splits, **UniverSeg** required a small **16-image support set** even for unseen datasets. Therefore, we provided 16 annotated images from each unseen dataset to ensure fair comparison.
